Seasonal snowpack in the Colorado Rockies acts as a natural reservoir, supplying over half of the annual surface water in the western United States. However, climate change is leading to reduced accumulation and earlier snowmelt, introducing greater uncertainty into water planning. Traditional forecasting tools — statistical regressions and physics-based snow models — struggle to generalize under shifting climate patterns and are often limited by manual calibration requirements.

This project investigates the use of machine learning for near-term forecasting of snow water equivalent (SWE) and melt timing using publicly available historical data. We combine ground-based measurements from Colorado’s SNOTEL network with satellite-derived MODIS snow cover and gridded climate data from PRISM to construct a feature-rich time series. The primary objective is to build and evaluate supervised learning models, including random forests, gradient boosting, and LSTMs, that can predict SWE at a given location based on recent meteorological and snowpack conditions.

The project emphasizes forecast accuracy, model interpretability, and potential utility for water resource management. By comparing machine learning models against traditional baseline approaches, we aim to assess the viability of ML-driven snowpack prediction under a changing climate.
