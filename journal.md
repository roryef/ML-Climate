## Week of March 30th

### Goals for This Week
- [X] Finalize abstract
- [X] Finish assumptions
- [ ] Clean and preprocess dataset
- [ ] Set up baseline ML model

### Who Did What
- Rory: 
- Sarika: Rewrote abstraction, wrote out assumptions with sources

### Blockers / Challenges
- Need to find more accurate cost of electricity from solar and wind as it is based on 2023

### Next Steps
- Find datasets for training algorithm
- determine best suitable algorithm to use on data sets

### Notes/Questions
Ask professor: 
- Can we assume hypothetical data centers in West Virginia and Arizona but do we need to use real operational data?
- Is it okay if our cost of electricity from solar and wind is fixed and not dynamically based on the market?
